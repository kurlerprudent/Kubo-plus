## 📋 SAMPLE TEST DATA FOR INTEGRATION

### Login Credentials (Pre-seeded)
```javascript
// Doctor Account
{
  "email": "doctor@rad.com",
  "password": "Doctor123!",
  "role": "DOCTOR"
}

// Admin Account  
{
  "email": "admin@rad.com",
  "password": "Admin123!",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}

// SuperAdmin Account
{
  "email": "superadmin@rad.com", 
  "password": "SuperAdmin123!",
  "role": "SUPER_ADMIN"
}
```

### Patient Registration Example
```javascript
{
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "patient@test.com",
  "password": "Patient123!",
  "phone": "+1234567893",
  "gender": "Female",

## 🚀 FRONTEND INTEGRATION CHECKLIST

### ✅ Essential Implementation Points

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login requires: `email`, `password`, `role`
   - Store JWT token for authenticated requests
   - Include role selection in login UI
   - Handle token expiration (24h)

2. **Request Headers**
   ```javascript
   headers: {
     'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
     'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   }
   ```

3. **Role-Based UI**
   - DOCTOR: Access to dashboard metrics, upload, analysis
   - ADMIN: Access to user management, system settings
   - PATIENT: Limited to profile management (pending approval)

4. **File Upload Implementation**
   - Avatar: Use multipart/form-data
   - X-ray: Support medical image formats (DICOM recommended)
   - Handle upload progress and error states

5. **Error Handling**
   - 401: Redirect to login
   - 403: Show insufficient permissions message
   - 400: Display validation errors
   - 500: Show generic error message

### 🔄 Workflow Integration

**Doctor Dashboard Flow**:
```
Login → Dashboard Overview → Upload X-ray → Start Analysis → Monitor Status → View Results
```

**Patient Registration Flow**:
```
Register → Await Approval → Login → Access Limited Features
```

**Analysis Management Flow**:
```
Upload Files → Create Analysis Jobs → Track Progress → Generate Reports
```
